            <title><![CDATA[Backstory]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Backstory</h1><p>As I was growing up, I became fascinated with computers and technology. I taught myself the AppleSoft BASIC programming language on my old Apple IIgs at the age of 12 years old, and haven't slowed down since. I had an affinity for taking appliances apart, and putting them back together, which was inspired by my drive to know how things work. More often than not, the things I disassembled worked even better than before. Meanwhile, my corner of our basement was growing, and I was building small robots, laser communicators, and automated doo-hickey's.

I was home-schooled though high school, and after graduating in 2001, didn't really have a clear direction I wanted to move towards. I started an Associates Degree course in Electronics Engineering Technology, but soon realized that my love was computers. I dropped the course halfway through, and started studying for IT certifications.  After a year or so, I began my own business, Knight Technology Solutions.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/cc38b4372096aaeb73bc0f2f4b665d13ea03872d.jpg"></article>]]></description>
