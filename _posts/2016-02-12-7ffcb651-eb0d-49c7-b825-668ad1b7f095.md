Virtual IT staffing
![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/c7a89f31-a6cc-4c5c-8fbf-69db02b12923.jpg)

If you are a small business, you probably think that you cannot afford a full-time IT staff. The problem is, most businesses have ALOT of time and money invested in computer systems, email, document storage, etc., and to lose access to any or all of this can be devastating.

This is where I come in with Virtual IT Staffing. I provide IT service contracts to maintain and work with you and your employees. Anything a full time IT staff can do, I can do! I have multiple industry certifications, including Microsoft Systems Administrator, Security+, A+, and more.

I can provide 24/7 emergency response and monitoring, regular maintenance, and fast implementation on new projects.

It's all the advantages of a full time IT staff, without the complications.
