I have had alot of experience designing and building websites, both for personal or private use, and also for businesses, and other commercial purposes.  ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/83a57a81-9da0-4105-ad4c-cf21b06a51f4.png)

For every business, a website is one of the most important resources you
have. A good website can function as a marketing portal, storefront, 
Customer service center, even as a tool to help you internally. A well 
designed website can be all of the above, while a poorly designed site 
can reflect badly for you company.

I've designed and built a full-featured news site using Joomla, with lots of custom coding, and created a photography portfolio/gallery/online store for my brother, who is an avid photographer.

I've built and maintained websites for several local non-profits, including the Virginia Way Museum Foundation, and the Lee Hall Train Station Foundation.
